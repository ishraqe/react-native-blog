## Built With
 - [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
 - [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
 - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

This is my very first application built with react native. I built this application in hope of learning. It was a rollercoster ride all along. 
For database i used Firebase. 

I would really appricate any suggestions, feedback, PRs and Issues.


## Walkthrough

![Preview](./src/assets/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif)

In Singn in and Sign Up i used components own state combining Redux state.Although there is awesome validation provided by  firebase, i used my own custom validation rules. 


Upon successful sign in or sign up, the user will be directed to the timeline page. These page are created using the [React native router flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux). 
Chossing [React native router flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) was a tricky decision. I was following some tutorials where they used [React native navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) by wix. Due to some unexpected circumstances i had to move to [React native router flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux).
I will try to use Navigation provided by React native official in near future for exploring more. 

The Home View is consists of three tabs -

 - Timeline
 - Create new blog
 - Notifications (which is under developed)

These are swipeable tabs that are created by using the library [React native router flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux). 
The top navigation bar comes also with it. There is also a drawer or side bar present there.  It consists of

- Home
- Profile
- Settings

The "Timeline" component is a basically [Flat list](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist.html).  All the data are coming from  firebase NoSQL database. 
The next "Create New blog" component is used for creating a new post to the timeline. 

The sidebar component's home redirects to timeline. Where profile displays only users post.
In settings user can change name, email, password and profile picture. 

### Future Development: 
 - Blog Actions (Like, comments )
 - Notifications 
 - [AsyncStorage](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/asyncstorage.html) for storing user information and getting logged in. 
 - [Animation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html) 
 
Being a fresher in this platform adapting animations was quite hard. I hope to master the [Animated API](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html) and implement it in this project. I have plan adding those while component mount and unmount , scroll, press. Basically on every users action to make it more interactive.  

### Debugging & crash-reporting:

Debugging of was pretty straight forward using the built in debug option. Rather than this i used [React native debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger), which gives me more flexibilty of debugging and waching over redux state. 

Upon installing the app i had faced some issues that caused the app crash and my bust my head of. By searching and asking on different communities i found some pretty good crash report tools. Among them i found love in [bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/). They came up with some pretty good well formatted crash report. 


## How to create your own copy of this app?
### Prerequisites
To create an own copy of this application, you have some prerequisites. They are -

 - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system.
 - [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) installed on your system.
 - Have the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and paths set properly. 
 - An android emulator or real device to run the app.
 - A google account for having [Firebase Web](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) configuration.

### Make own copy
First clone the repository using:

    git clone https://github.com/ishraqe/react-native-blog.git

Then install the dependencies using:

    npm install

At this point you need to have the configurations for a Firebase App. Just go to [Firebase Console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) and follow the instructions. Then open the file named `App.js` from the `src` folder. Add the Firebase configurations to the file. The file looks something like this:

    // import and configure firebase
    import  firebase from 'firebase';
    
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: [YOUR API KEY],
      authDomain: [YOUR AUTH DOMAIN],
      databaseURL: [YOUR DATABASE URL],
      storageBucket: [STORAGE BUCKET],
    }
    export const firebaseApp = firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig)

 Run the following command to run the app on the emulator.

    react-native run-android
Now, you have your own copy of this application!
